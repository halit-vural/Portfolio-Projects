## Classification

### Churn Prediction for Bank Customer

The dataset contains details of a bank's customers. The target of the project is to predict the churn of the customer. The target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues.

#### Methods used
Deep Learning with Tensorflow,
Pandas,
Class weights

### Fraud Detection


### Heart-stroke Prediction
This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:

- Cleveland: 303 observations
- Hungarian: 294 observations
Switzerland: 123 observations
Long Beach VA: 200 observations
Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations
Total: 1190 observations
Duplicated: 272 observations
